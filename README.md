# Winding Tree Rooms

Winding Tree's `Rooms` is an easy to use web application in ReactJS and NodeJS for small hoteliers to manage their inventory and expose it to the Winding Tree marketplace.

It aims at replacing the traditional *Pen and Paper* approach, but does not provide the depth of features and capabilities of a Channel Manager or Property Management System.

The project is open-source with an MIT license, meaning anyone can copy and use it for commercial usage. We do however appreciate sponsors and pull requests for any exciting features you would like to contribute back!
